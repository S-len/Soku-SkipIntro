# Soku-SkipIntro (REQUIRES SOKUENGINE)
A Soku intro skip module. 

## Features
Lets you skip the usually unskippable intro and either go directly into the menu, or into practice mode (where it also lets you configure character/deck/palette)
While it doesn't really use anything from Soku Engine, the delayed loading means I don't have to bother finding a function to hook myself.

## Usage
Just place the module in your /Module/ folder and either configure the SkipIntro.ini file by hand or via SokuEngine.
Info about which how to configure the module can be found within the config file.
